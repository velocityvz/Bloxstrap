        > Do **NOT** open an issue if you're getting a "No root access" or fallback-related error. Learn more [here](https://github.com/FrosSky/Chevstrap/wiki/No-root-access).
        > Always use the latest version, downloadable [here](https://github.com/FrosSky/Chevstrap/releases/latest).

        ### Preliminary Instructions
        - Before opening an issue, please [check the Wiki](https://github.com/FrosSky/Chevstrap/wiki/) to see if your problem has already been addressed.
          - If it has **not**, mention which Wiki pages you read that seemed relevant.
          - Issues **will be closed without warning** if a Wiki page already addresses your problem. We try to check everything, but we might not be able to respond to or close every single issue.
        - If your issue involves **Roblox crashing or not launching**, [check this guide](https://github.com/FrosSky/Chevstrap/wiki/Roblox-Crash-&-Launch-Issues-(Android)).
          - Only report the issue **if it only occurs with Chevstrap**, and clearly state that.
        - Ensure you're using the **latest version** of Chevstrap. Reports based on outdated versions will not be supported.
